gitcrypt-test
==============

Just a test of git-crypt - which was found at this [blog post](http://ebarnouflant.com/posts/3-using-git-crypt-to-transparently-encrypt-sensitive-data-in-a-git-repository).

If it works - then you shouldn't be able to read the cleartext of the included secretfile.

Or the sooper-sekret-passwords.yml file either.

So close - yet so far.
